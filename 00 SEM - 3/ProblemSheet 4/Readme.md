## Assignment Questions

### 1. Vehicle and Two-Wheeler Class
Design a class called `Vehicle` that includes appropriate data members. Derive a class `TwoWheeler` from `Vehicle` which adds the data members `distance` and `mileage`. Demonstrate the use of **method overloading** and **multilevel inheritance**.

### 2. Patient and IPD Classes
Create a base class `Patient` and a class `IPD` with data members `ward_no`, `bed_no`, and `charge_per_day`. Derive a class `IPD_Patient` from both `Patient` and `IPD` with an additional data member `no_of_days_admitted`.

### 3. Employee Management System
- Design appropriate classes for an **Employee Management System**.
- Use **inheritance** to model different employee types.
- Utilize constructors to initialize members of the classes.

### 4. Supermarket Billing System
- Design appropriate classes to create a **Supermarket Billing System**.
- Use **inheritance** to manage various types of products or customers.
- Utilize constructors to initialize members of the system.
