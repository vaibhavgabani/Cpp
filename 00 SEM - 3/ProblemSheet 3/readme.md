## Topic: Operator Overloading

This repository contains the solutions for the Object-Oriented Programming (305) Assignment-III, focusing on Operator Overloading in C++. Each solution demonstrates the use of operator overloading to simplify operations and create more intuitive C++ classes.

## Assignment Questions

### 1. Addition of Two Matrices Using Operator Overloading
Develop a program that creates a class `Matrix` for representing a 2D matrix and overloads the `+` operator to add two matrices together. Ensure that matrix dimensions are validated before performing the addition.

### 2. Time Class with Operator Overloading
Develop a class `Time` with the following data members:
- `hours` (int)
- `minutes` (int)
- `seconds` (int)

The program should overload the following operators:
- **`==` operator**: To check if two `Time` objects represent the same time.
- **`>>` operator**: For inputting time in the format `hours:minutes:seconds`.
- **`<<` operator**: For displaying time in a readable format.

### 3. Toggle Word
Write a program to toggle the case of each character in a string. That is, convert uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa.

### 4. CString Class with Operator Overloading
Develop a `CString` class to represent strings, and overload the following operators:
- **`+` operator**: To concatenate two strings.
- **`==` operator**: To check if two strings are equal.
- **`!=` operator**: To check if two strings are not equal.
- **`<` operator**: To check if one string is lexicographically smaller than the other.
- **`<=` operator**: To check if one string is lexicographically smaller or equal to the other.
- **`>` operator**: To check if one string is lexicographically greater than the other.
- **`>=` operator**: To check if one string is lexicographically greater or equal to the other.

### 5. Binary Class with Operator Overloading
Create a class `Binary` that contains a single float data member. Overload the four basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to operate on binary numbers. Additionally, overload the insertion (`<<`) and extraction (`>>`) operators for input and output of binary values.
