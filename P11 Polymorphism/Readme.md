This repository contains examples and explanations of polymorphism in C++.

## What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common super type. It is the ability of different objects to respond to the same function call in different ways.

## Types of Polymorphism

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism** (or Static Polymorphism)
   - Achieved using function overloading and operator overloading.
   - **Function Overloading:** Functions with the same name but different parameters.
   - **Operator Overloading:** Operators have different implementations depending on their arguments.
   
2. **Run-time Polymorphism** (or Dynamic Polymorphism)
   - Achieved using inheritance and virtual functions.
   - **Inheritance:** A derived class inherits properties and behavior from a base class.
   - **Virtual Functions:** Functions in a base class that can be overridden in derived classes to provide specific implementations.

## Function Overloading

Function overloading allows multiple functions to have the same name but operate on different types or numbers of parameters. This enables a single function name to work in different ways based on arguments.

## Operator Overloading

Operator overloading allows you to redefine the way operators work for user-defined types. For example, you can define how the `+` operator works for a class representing complex numbers.

## Virtual Functions

Virtual functions enable a base class to declare functions that can be overridden in any derived class. This allows derived classes to provide specific implementations for these functions. When a base class pointer points to a derived class object, the appropriate function is called based on the object type, not the pointer type.
